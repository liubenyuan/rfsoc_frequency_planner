# RFSoC Frequency Planner
This RFSoC Frequency Planning tool is derived from an original tool released by Xilinx for their Zynq Ultrascale+ RFSoC line of devices. The original tool, and more information about the RFSoC can be found [here](https://www.xilinx.com/products/silicon-devices/soc/rfsoc.html).

This repository consists of two branches. The ```main``` branch is used for the standalone web application that is hosted on [Heroku](https://rfsoc-frequency-planner.herokuapp.com/). The ```rfsoc_studio``` branch is compatible with [PYNQ image v2.7](https://github.com/Xilinx/PYNQ/releases).

## PYNQ Quick Start
All that is required to install the RFSoC frequency planner on to your development board is running a simple line of code in the command line. **However, you will need to connect your board to the internet.** Follow the instructions below to install the frequency planner now.
* Power on your PYNQ enabled development board with an SD Card containing a fresh PYNQ v2.7 image.
* Navigate to Jupyter Labs by opening a browser (preferably Chrome) and connecting to `http://<board_ip_address>:9090/lab`.
* We need to open a terminal in Jupyter Lab. Firstly, open a launcher window as shown in the figure below:
